# Mixture of Experts Vision System

A new system architecture based on mixture of experts.

## Goal

Build a comprehensive vision system that aggregates multiple specialized models
(captioning, object detection, facial recognition, etc.) under one intelligent
aggregator model.

## Architecture

- **Expert Models**: Specialized models (Captioning, Object Recognition, Facial
  Recognition, etc)
- **Aggregator Model**: Intelligent coordinator that processes and combines
  expert outputs
- **Unified Interface**: Single point of access for user interface

## Current Models

- **BLIP**: Image captioning
- **Yolo**: Object detection

## Future Models

- Object detection
- Facial recognition
- Scene understanding
- Action recognition
- And more...

## Repo Notes

- models folder contain experimental models & not aggregated by main.py
