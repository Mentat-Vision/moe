# Mixture of Experts Vision System

A new system architecture based on mixture of experts for unified computer
vision analysis.

## Goal

Build a comprehensive vision system that aggregates multiple specialized models
(captioning, object detection, facial recognition, etc.) under one intelligent
aggregator model. The system provides a unified interface that ties all data
logs together for seamless user interaction.

## Architecture

- **Expert Models**: Specialized vision models (BLIP, Florence, etc.)
- **Aggregator Model**: Intelligent coordinator that processes and combines
  expert outputs
- **Unified Interface**: Single point of access for all vision analysis results

## Current Models

- **BLIP**: Image captioning with optimized performance
- **Florence**: Advanced image captioning with detailed descriptions

## Future Models

- Object detection
- Facial recognition
- Scene understanding
- Action recognition
- And more...

The system will evolve to include additional expert models while maintaining a
cohesive user experience through the central aggregator.
